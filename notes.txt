created files first public then temp then .gitignore .gitkeep then
.env :- to save credientials like api keys 
in package.json :- type module why??
now common js and ESmodule are module system basically
Common js:-1. Synchronous download module---means execute immediately
2. Primarily used in Node.js, though it can be bundled for browsers using tools like Webpack.
3.Uses module.exports to export.
 Uses require() to import.
 ES js:----.mjs---file extension--1.Modules are loaded asynchronously using import
 2.Works in both browsers and Node.js (with some configuration)
 3.Uses export to export.
  Uses import to import.
  ----we we want to use both file extension .cjs and .mjs type module also

when we do changes in our files we have to start and stop server everytime so not do so 
--watch but not in production now or we can simply download utility like nodemon
nodemon :- as you save it restarts the server it is a dev dependency 
means only used in devlopment mode not in production does not whether the file is heavy or not
how to install npm i -D nodemon 
then in package.json in scripts write dev : nodemon src/index.js
means jb bhi mein npm run dev kru index.js ko start kr dena
